# PyFlora
PyFlora is a Python project focused on IoT (Internet of Things) with a user-friendly GUI created using the Tkinter toolkit. The application allows users to monitor and optimize the environment for plants within their house. With PyFlora, users can track various sensor readings such as humidity, temperature, brightness, pH, and salinity for each plant.

## Features
### Sensor Monitoring: PyFlora displays a graphical interface showcasing all plants in the house along with their respective sensor readings. Users can easily view the current status of each plant's environment.

### Optimization: With a simple button press, users can optimize all sensors to maintain the optimal environment for plant growth.

### Graphical Representation: PyFlora provides graphical representations of sensor data through line, pie, and histogram graphs (note: these graphs are for presentation purposes and are not fully functional yet).

### Pot Management: Users can add, update, and delete pots associated with plants within the application.

### Plant Care Information: PyFlora includes a frame dedicated to providing plant care information based on the selected plant.

## Compatibility
### Operating System: Developed and tested on Windows 10. Visual changes may occur on different operating systems such as macOS.

### Python Version: PyFlora is compatible with the latest Python version 3.11.6.
